Submitted by: **Vivian Sung**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I used several tutorials from w3schools.com when learning how to style images and backgrounds in css. I mainly followed the Pre-work assigment instructions, and used Google to look up a background image and colors for my program.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[One challenge I faced when creating this submission was lack of experience and time, as I wanted to create a submission but was limited in knowledge and skill. 
I have never written anything in HTML, CSS, or Javascript before, nor have I heard of Glitch, so creating this submission was very new and exciting. It was quite 
a challenge for me because of all of the foreign syntax and language forms, and I wanted to be able to learn and understand all of the code during the short amount 
of time I had to create this submission. Although the instructions were extremely helpful and walked me through step by step, I still had many gaps in and limitations 
in knowledge even after completing the program due to inexperience in web development, so I wanted to learn more. I knew that I had only covered the very top layer of 
these languages as well and had only seen just the tip of the iceberg, so I was a bit pressured as I wanted to create too much with knowing only the basics. Due to lack of
time, I wasn't able to completely focus solely on learning web development for this assignment, but I made sure to read all of the content presented in the instructions 
and the websites listed, as well as read outside resources such as w3schools or other websites on introduction to web development. As a result, I was able to create a 
web application for the first time. Even though I was unable to include the optional features of the game, I am still satisfied with my progress, and will continue to learn
and improve my skills in web development so that I can create without limits in the future.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[As I am still quite a beginner in web development, I have many questions about HTML, CSS, Javascript, how they work on their own as well as with eachother, and even the how the internet 
works in general. For example, how is a website's address or url created? How is the code written in these three languages processed by the web and the computer? In addition, I often see 
beautifully designed websites with stunning visuals and smooth transitions, or even those that can load thousands of different games: what softwares or programming languages are most often 
used to build or create these more complex websites, and how do they differ from using HTML, CSS, and Javascript? What happens when the programs or code we write gets extremely long or 
complex, and how does the user make changes to improve the loading speed of the website? And most importantly, what are some good editors, resources, and tips to best improve on and expand 
web development skills?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a bit more time to work on this project, I would definitely work on adding functionality to the game, and making it more unique and creative. I would definitely add
different sounds, as well as possibly provide some sort of output to let the user know what level they are on, and how many guesses they have (if I can add guesses to the game). 
I would also try to spice up the buttons more, maybe adding some visual effects or animations to make the game more interesting. If I could, I would like to create a random sequence
for each new game, and be able to have the user continue until they answer incorrectly, so there is some sort of "high score" that can be stored and displayed. In addition, each level
would increase in difficulty so that the user does not lose interest and become bored. However, I am not there yet in terms of skill or knowledge, but I would like to implement these
functions if I had the time.]
